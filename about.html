      <h2>About Founders Bridge</h2>
      <p>
        Founders Bridge exists to solve one simple but critical problem:
        great founders often struggle to access the right investors at the right time.

  <!-- OUR MISSION -->
  <section class="hero">
    <div class="container">
      <h2>Our Mission</h2>
      <p>
        Our mission is to help founders become truly investor-ready and
        connect them with investors and mentors who align with their vision,
        stage, and industry.
      </p>
      <p>
        We believe fundraising should be based on preparation, clarity,
        and relevance — not cold emails or random pitch sharing.
      </p>

  <!-- WHY WE BUILT THIS -->
  <section class="hero">
    <div class="container">
      <h2>Why We Built Founders Bridge</h2>
      <p>
        Many founders fail to raise funding not because their ideas are weak,
        but because they lack access, guidance, and structured presentation.
      </p>
      <p>
        At the same time, investors are overwhelmed with unfiltered pitches
        that don’t match their focus.
      </p>
      <p>
        Founders Bridge was created to bring structure, preparation,
        and trust to this process — benefiting both sides.
